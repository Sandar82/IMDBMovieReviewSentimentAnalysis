IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using the IMDB dataset, which consists of 25,000 reviews. Sentiment analysis is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics that helps determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. The IMDB dataset provides a substantial benchmark for binary sentiment classification, offering a rich source of data for training and testing machine learning models.

## Dataset Information
### Context
The IMDB dataset contains 25,000 highly polar movie reviews, with 12,500 reviews labeled as positive and 12,500 as negative. The dataset is split evenly between training and testing sets, each containing 12,500 reviews. This large dataset provides a robust basis for binary sentiment classification, allowing for a thorough evaluation of model performance.

### Dataset Usage
•	Full Dataset: 25,000 reviews (12,500 positive and 12,500 negative).
•	Reduced Dataset: If memory issues arise, consider using a reduced dataset (e.g., 6,000 reviews) while maintaining an equal number of positive and negative reviews. This reduction should be clearly documented in the notebook.

### Project Task
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the number of positive and negative reviews using classification techniques. The key steps involved in this process include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

### Implementation Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
•	Remove Punctuation: Clean the text by removing punctuation marks to reduce noise in the data.
•	Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens (words) for easier analysis.
•	Stopwords Removal: Remove common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "in") that do not contribute significant meaning to the text.
•	Lemmatization/Stepping: Normalize words to their base or root form to reduce variability.
2. Feature Extraction
•	TFIDF Vectorization: Transform the text data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) vectorization. This technique converts the textual data into a format that can be used by machine learning models while emphasizing the importance of rarer words.
3. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
•	GridSearchCV: Use GridSearchCV to explore different parameter settings and optimize the performance of the models.
o	Random Forest Classifier: Train a Random Forest model and tune its hyperparameters.
o	Gradient Boosting Classifier: Alternatively, use XGBoost if Gradient Boosting is computationally expensive during GridSearchCV.
4. Model Evaluation
•	Final Evaluation: Evaluate the models on the test dataset using the best parameter settings identified during GridSearchCV. Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to compare model performance.
5. Report the Best Performing Model
•	Model Reporting: Identify and report the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics. Provide insights into why this model performed better and how it can be applied to future sentiment analysis tasks.

### Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to binary sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset. By following the steps outlined above, the project aims to build a reliable model that can accurately predict the sentiment of movie reviews, offering valuable insights for applications in natural language processing and text analytics.
